# Unbeatable-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a paper and pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. I designed a digital version of Tic Tac Toe, Player vs Computer. Using Artificial Intelligence concept, I designed the computer version to not get beaten. Player cannot beat computer but a tie is possible.
